# Please adapt the `project_name`, `project_version` and `main_class` variables to fit your own project.
# The generated JARs will be named as target/build/[project_name]-[main_class]-[project_version].jar
# NOTE: `main_class` is a list of space separated classes to generate as many JAR as listed classes.
## Add external JAR dependencies (mostly in ./libs) by using the JARS variable.
# e.g.: JARS="./libs/flexmark-all-0.64.8-lib.jar ./libs/org.eclipse.jgit-7.2.0.202503040940-r.jar"
